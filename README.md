# Test Driven Development with Cypress & React

For this activity, you've been given a skeleton React app and a full Cypress testing suite. You will use the testing suite to determine what needs to exist in your React application. 

### Set Up

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `npm i` 
4. Run `npm start` to run the app locally
5. Run `npm run cypress` to run the testing suite

### Workflow

You'll notice that all the tests are skipped. Start by going to `cypress` > `integration` > `iteration1.spec.js`. Then, unskip the first test and run it. You should fail it. Remember the red > green testing cycle? You're going to be using that over and over while working through this activity! Anyways...you failed the test (RED!), so now it's time to write the necessary code to pass that test (GREEN!). Once you've passed that test, unskip the next one, run it, fail it, write the code, pass it, repeat. Work your way through all of the iteration files! At the end, you should havea functioning app!
